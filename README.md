# MSP430 - Set Servomotor position based on Ultrasonic Sensor distance measurement
## Overview
This project contains a C code that configures the MSP430F5529, the ultrassonic sensor HC-SR04 and a servomotor to measure distance and based on it, turn on/off the red and green LEDs from the MSP430 and set the servomotor position. Below there's a graph that contains the relationship between the distance measured and the servo position.
